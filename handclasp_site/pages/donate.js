                            Every dollar sent to Handclasp for sponsored students goes to Hilltribes Resource &#38; Development Centers in Thailand. No Admin costs are deducted from that money. Admin costs are covered by special donations.

                                    April is the costliest month of the year. HRDC must buy uniforms, books and shoes for every student. (Some uniforms are recycled) Entry to Thai school is NOT allowed without these items. Education fees are also paid.

                                    Those living at a Center are fed daily at the Center and school. (The Thai Government provides lunch rice and UHT milk for all students) For some NON Handclasp kids, this is all they ever get! Handclasp students living at home are checked and where food is short, the whole family gets a provision of rice and milk.

                                    HRDC is a Christian organization. Every student is exposed to Christian teaching. Some are just "loved" into God's Kingdom. Some remain Buhdist to comply with family tradition. All are invited to participate in Camp Joy (Karen VBS) and bring friends.

                                    HRDC provides medical treatment. (Some NGOs only do "check ups", and do NOT treat illness) Dental care is difficult as students are taught to never complain! Our Medical staff are working on this and truckloads of students have been to the Local Clinics for treatment last year. Providing prescription glasses is costly, therefore requires special donations to coverthe cost.

                                    Trucks take some Center students to school. Smaller students get preference, Village students live closer usually walk. Trucks take them to the city for treatment, go to other villages for outreach and sometimes to go home for vacation. All supplies are carried to the villages on HRDC trucks.  Without this transportation, villages will be without food and supplies.

Generous donors have made this possible for the last 5 years. For many students it is their first gift EVER.

                                    Sahamit (Friendship) school at Museekee is funded by the Baptist Church. Students living at Musekee Center attending Sahamit can operate on $20 per month. Some towns like Maechem, Pai and Maehongson have schools funded by the Queens Royal Project. They provide more Agricultural courses. Hostel accom there is more expensive. City High Schools have the best academics but sponsors must elect to pay more to have their student live in Chiangmai. Not all students are prepared to live in the city.

                                    This year Handclasp has a new college program. Sponsors have elected to pay for their student to attend a college suited to their vocation. Most colleges and universities here cost $1000 USA per year! They can follow a course to become a Nurse, Teacher, Doctor, Business manager. Help is needed here as more students achieve better grades and are prepared for City Life. We invite all sponsors to ask questions and to visit their students on a planned trip. Thank you for being part of this program. It is our privilege to serve you as we serve the students and staff.
